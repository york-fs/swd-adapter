# SWD Programming Adapter

Enables a reliable connection between an **ST-Link clone** and a **1.27 mm 2×3 pin IDC connector**.  
Power output can be configured for **3.3 V** or **5 V** (default: **5 V**).

## Usage

- Connect the adapter to the ST-Link clone **with the board facing upward**.  
- Select the desired power level using the **solder bridge**:  
  - **5 V** is connected by default.  
  - To switch to **3.3 V**, **cut the 5 V bridge** and **solder the 3.3 V bridge** instead.  
- **Verify your ST-Link clone’s pinout** before making any connections.
